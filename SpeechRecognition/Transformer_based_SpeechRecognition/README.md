## Transformer based Speech Recognition
`ASR` consists of transcribing audio speech segments into text. ASR can be treated as a sequence-to-sequence problem, where audio can be represented as a sequence of `feature vectors` and text as a sequence of characters, words, subword tokens.

Dataset used will `LJSpeech` and we have a `Tranformer (Encoder and Decoder)`.
