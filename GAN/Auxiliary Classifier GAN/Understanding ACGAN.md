# Understanding ACGAN 
ACGAN is `Auxilary Classifier GAN`. 

`ACGAN` is a GAN that works well in image synthesis. You simply tell it a `class label` and it will generate an image -- all from <b><i>complete noise </i></b>. 

Images generated by `ACGAN` are of a high resolution. It checks the discriminability using a pretrained `Inception` network.

## Architecture
The `ACGAN` consists of a generator and a discriminator. In this every generated sample has corresponding class label `c ~ C (Available Classes)` in addition to noise `z`.

This class label `c` helps the `ACGAN` to synthesize the image based on the label passed. The generator `G` uses both the class label and the noise `z` to generate the image. 

The generated images can be represented as-

`Generator` consists a series of `Deconvolutional` layers (`ConvTranspose2D`). `ReLU` is used as the activation here.

The `Discriminator` contains a set `2D Convolutional` modules with `LeakyReLU` followed by linear layers and a `softmax` and `sigmoid` function for each of its outputs â€” detecting the class and the source of the `model`.

## Loss Function
